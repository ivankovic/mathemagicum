# Mathemagicum — Game Design

## Concept

A cozy, player-vs-environment farming/gardening game. "PvE" here means the
environment (terrain, timing, growth), not hostile creatures — **there are
no enemies and no combat.**

The educational core: every gardening action — planting, tending, growing,
harvesting — is performed by casting a **gardening spell**, and each spell
is a math minigame. The math isn't a quiz bolted onto a farming game; the
math *is* the gardening mechanic. Minigames are designed and added one at a
time, each tied to a specific gardening action and a specific math skill.

## Pillars

- **No conflict.** Challenge comes from terrain, timing, and math mastery —
  never from an opponent.
- **Math as magic.** Casting a spell (solving a minigame) is how you
  interact with the garden. No separate "quiz mode" bolted on the side.
- **Pixel-art world in a 3/4 top-down view.** Explored on foot, tile by
  tile. The ground is seen from directly above; buildings and objects are
  drawn from the front and stand up out of the tiles they occupy.
- **Learning over gating.** Every spell is available from the start — the
  goal is to encourage learning, not to reward progression with content.
  NPC teachers explain a spell and train it with partially solved
  problems (worked examples), but nothing is ever locked behind them.
- **No manipulative engagement mechanics.** This is a single-player
  educational game, not a live-service one — no artificial scarcity, no
  daily-login hooks, no grind economy engineered to maximize retention.
  If a player can earn effectively unlimited money by genuinely enjoying
  the loop of helping villagers (each time still requires actually
  solving a minigame — the friction is real engagement, not a timer),
  that's fine. Nothing here is trying to control how often someone plays.

## Core loop

1. Explore the world; note what terrain is where.
2. Pick a plant suited to that terrain.
3. Plant it (a direct action for now — the planting spell is not speced).
4. Tend it with further spells. The **addition spell** grows it one stage
   per cast, seedling → growing → mature; watering and the rest are TBD.
5. Harvest, expand, repeat.

## Systems

### Terrain

Multiple terrain types exist in the world simultaneously. Terrain governs
both where the player can walk and what can be planted where — it's a
constraint the player has to read the map for, not just decoration.

### Plants

Multiple plant types exist, each restricted to specific terrain types.
Which plant fits which terrain is part of the puzzle, independent of any
minigame.

### Gardening spells (math minigames)

Specified one at a time, each mapped to one gardening action (plant / tend
/ harvest / ...) and one math skill. Nothing beyond what is written below
should be assumed until a minigame is actually speced.

What is settled: spells are grouped by mathematical theme, and a spell's
in-game effect mirrors that theme rather than being an arbitrary skin —
e.g. a multiplication spell makes copies of an object, because that's
what multiplication is. All spells are available from the start (see
"Learning over gating" above); NPC teachers found around the world teach
and drill a spell's theme, they don't gate access to it. See
[`WORLD_GENERATION.md`](WORLD_GENERATION.md) for how teachers and spell
themes map onto specific areas.

Spells are reached through a **spellbook** button, which opens a tray of
runes; seeds through a **seed pouch** button beside it, which opens a tray
of crops. Both are the same widget and behave identically: tap the
container to see what is inside, tap one of those to plant or cast it
straight away, on the tile the player is facing. Neither container is
marked with any one of its contents — a plus on the book or a carrot on
the pouch would be wrong the moment there are two of either.

Nothing selects-then-confirms. A two-step action on a phone is two chances
to lose the tray to a stray tap, and it asks the player to read a caption
to find out what they are about to do.

#### The addition spell — growth (implemented)

**Action:** face a crop you have planted and cast it. One successful
cast moves the crop one growth stage: seedling → growing → mature. That
mapping is the theme rule above applied literally — the spell that adds is
the one that makes things grow, so planting drops a *seedling* and growth
is something the player does rather than something a timer does.

**Icon:** a plus.

**The minigame:** two randomly chosen three-digit numbers whose sum is
still under 1000, laid out on a number line. Three semicircular arrows jump
from the first number by the second number's ones, then its tens, then its
hundreds; under each arrow's landing point is a box the player fills in with
the running total. The order is fixed and enforced — answering the hundreds
first would mean adding the two numbers in your head and typing the answer,
which is the thing the number line exists to replace.

The line is drawn **schematically**, not to scale: the four points are
spaced evenly and each arrow's *height* carries how big its jump is. To
scale, a ones jump of at most 9 against a span of several hundred would be
invisible, and the first of the three arrows would not exist.

**No fail state.** A wrong answer marks the box, offers a hint that
escalates but never states the answer, and lets the player try again. A
spell is how the player gardens, and locking them out of gardening for
arithmetic would make the math a gate — see "Learning over gating" and "No
manipulative engagement mechanics" above.

Problem generation is uniform over the pairs that actually exist, not over
the addend with a start fitted around it; the addend's digits are all
non-zero so that none of the three arrows is a `+0` jump landing where it
started. `src/spells/addition.ts` is the whole of the rule, with no Phaser
in it, and `addition.test.ts` pins both the arithmetic and the
distribution.

### Day-night cycle

Reflects the player's actual real-world time of day (local clock), not a
simulated in-game clock — no time state to save, nothing to drift. Gates
NPC presence (every villager retreats indoors at night; the postal
worker's patrol is day-only) but explicitly *not* money or rewards — see
"No manipulative engagement mechanics" above. See
[`WORLD_GENERATION.md`](WORLD_GENERATION.md#day-night-cycle) for the
fuller brainstorm.

### Economy (embryonic)

Money exists as a concept — villagers reward it (alongside items) for
help with their plants, the village shopkeeper sells seeds/supplies for
it — but no prices, balance, or earning curve are designed. First
mentioned in [`WORLD_GENERATION.md`](WORLD_GENERATION.md) while designing
the Starting Village's NPCs.

## Current milestone

A player moving through a world of multiple terrain types, planting
multiple types of crop, and growing them with the first spell. Planting is
still a direct action — pick a seed from the pouch, or press a key — since
the planting spell is not speced. Both gardening actions work the tile the
player faces. Growth is real: a crop starts as a seedling and reaches
maturity in two casts of the addition spell. No harvest loop yet, and
nothing is saved between sessions.
